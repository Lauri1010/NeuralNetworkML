# Multilayer Neural Network Beta
Multilayered backpropagation neural network developed with c++

You must run the program on windows command prompt (win 10)
- NeuralM.exe 0 for training mode
- NeuralM.exe 1 for prediction mode

Note generating the training set may take several hours. The training set is saved to a binary file and then read for the prediction.
